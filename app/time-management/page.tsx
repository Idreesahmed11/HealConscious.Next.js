                What is Time Management?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Time management is the process of consciously planning how you spend your
                hours so that you can use them more effectively. It often involves setting
                priorities, breaking tasks into smaller steps, and creating systems that reduce
                stress while boosting productivity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed">
                Most people are familiar with the basics like writing to-do lists, setting
                deadlines, or rewarding themselves after finishing tasks. These tools work but
                real time management goes beyond checklists.

                Effective time management helps you be more productive and also impacts
                emotional well-being. When your days are structured with intention, your brain
                has less clutter to fight through and more energy to focus on what matters.

                The Psychology Behind Time Management
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The way we manage our time has a direct impact on how our brains function
                and how we feel day-to-day. Poor time management often leads to chronic
                stress, decision fatigue, and eventually burnout. When tasks pile up, the brain
                struggles to focus, leaving less energy for creativity and problem-solving.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
                On the other hand, building structured time habits work like a support system for
                the mind. Having routines in place reduces the constant pressure of{' '}
                <span className="font-bold text-black">&ldquo;what&apos;s next,&rdquo;</span>{' '}
                which lowers stress and builds confidence.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 text-[15px] leading-relaxed">
                Psychologists often describe this as creating{' '}
                <span className="font-bold text-black">mental space</span>
                . When your schedule is clear and realistic, your brain isn&apos;t weighed down by clutter.
                It&apos;s freer to think, adapt, and handle challenges with calm focus.
